      <p class="text-left">Carpe Noctum are recruiting for a cashier to work every Wednesday at the mighty Rock City. While experience isn't essential it is certainly preferable especially any cash handling.</p>

      <p class="text-left">We pay Â£8 per hour for your time. The job is ideally suited to those seeking to avoid a Wednesday night out rather than our biggest fans.</p>
