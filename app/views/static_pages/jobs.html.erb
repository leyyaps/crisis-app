        Carpe Noctum News needs an editor to snip and cut our weekly drunken cringefest. Ideally this needs to be someone who has an interest in video editing or film making and maybe has edited some homemade stuff before as part of a society, group project or just for kicks. Software subscriptions will be provided. <br>
        Work it around your studies and get Â£25 per week for each one you make (approx 2hr work once you get the hang of it)<br>

        <strong>Deadline for applications: Friday 1st September</strong>
